# Chapter 2 - Exercises 2.1

### 2.1-1 Insertion sort

Illustrate the operation of Insertion-Sort on an array intially
containing the sequence (31,41,59,26,41,58):

(31,41,59,26,41,58)

31 - 41,59,26,41,58
31,41 - 59,26,41,58
31,41,59 - 26,41,58
26,31,41,59 - 41,58
26,31,41,41,59 - 58
26,31,41,41,58,59

### 2.2-2 Sum-Array - loop invariant

Consider the procedure Sum-Array on p.24. It computes the sum of
the n numbers in array A[0:n-1]. State a loop invariant for this
procedure, and use its initialization, maintenance, and termination
properties to show that the Sum-Array procedure returns the sum of
the numbers in A[0:n-1].

```
Sum-Array(A,n):
    sum = 0
    for i = 0 to n - 1:
        sum = sum + A[i]
    
    return sum
```

The loop invariant is that the sum up to i is equal to A[0:i].
