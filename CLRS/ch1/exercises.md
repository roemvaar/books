# Chapter 1 - Exercises

1.1-1 Sorting in real-world: 

* Sorting books by name/author in a public library
*  Sorting people for immigration when they arrive from an international flight
* Sorting your tasks priorities from work

Sorting that requires finding the shortest distance between two points:

1) If you sell things online, and you need to deliver more than one of them,
you would like to efficient your time and gas, therefore you would have to
list all the adddresses you need to visit, and then sort them, using the shortest
path to go from one place to another/

1.1-2 Other than speed, other measures to consider in real-world:

* Gas prices
* Distance
* Time
* Road speed limits

1.1-3 Data structure - strenghts and limitations

Hash-Table: one of my favorite data structures.

Pros:

* Constant time (amortyzed) for multiple operations - insertion, searching, deletion

Cons:

* Take a lot of memory
* Complex - not included as part of the C standard library (that's a bummer for embedded software
engineers)
* Collisions - Hard to develop a good hash function
