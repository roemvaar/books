"If computers were infinitely fast and computer memory were free, would you have
any reason to study algorithms? The answer is yes, if for no other reason than that
you would still like to be certain that your solution method terminates and does so
with the correct answer."

You should choose algorithms that use the reouserces of time and space efficiently.
