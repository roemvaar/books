# Design Patterns

Patterns is a solution to a problem in a context.

The design patterns are descriptions of communicating objects and
and classes that are customized to solve a general design problem
in a particular context.

**A pattern has four essential elements:**

1. The **pattern name** - it describes a design problem, its solution, and 
   consequences in a word or two.

2. The **problem** - describes when to apply the pattern. It explains the problem
   and its context.

3. The **solution** - describes the elements that make up the design, their
   relationships, responsibilities, and collaborations.

4. The **consequences** - are the results and trade-offs of applying the pattern.

**Three main patterns types:**

* Creational Patterns

* Structural Patterns

* Behavioral Patterns
